Autonomous navigation is one of the most interesting problems among computer vision community. Although a considerable research has already been taken place in this area, vision based full autonomy is still not fully addressed and there are a number of issues to be addresses before full autonomy can be deployed in large scale around the globe. In this research we try to overcome the issue of deploying a single model which is dynamically adaptive to the varying driving context without forgetting the experience learned from other similar but slightly different contexts. In addition to that training such a system in real world is a challenging task. This research aims at producing an end-to-end vision based system for navigation based on conditionally generated feature maps which are dynamically adaptive to the context. Also we focus on efficiently training such systems from pre-recorded real world large scale diverse data as well as practically training in real world.
