\item Critically review the literature with regards to following topics in order to identify and justify the problem statement.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computer Vision and Deep Learning
		\item Training deep neural networks
		\item Vision Based Navigation
	\end{itemize}

\item Develop individual tools to generate contextualized feature maps from input images where the models are dynamically adaptive to the nature of input. Initially these models will be trained with pixel wise human annotated outputs such as road/lane detection, drivable area detection etc. with the help of supervised learning

%3
\item  Extend the system to extract temporal information using Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN). Input frames are fed to the models developed in the previous stage which outputs feature maps to be fed in to RNN in each time step.

%4
\item Handover to the model, the responsibility of training feature map extractors from merely input frame sequence and corresponding expected navigation command, say steering direction and desired velocity. Remove pixel-wise annotated expected output maps where the only output system can observe is the navigation commands. Models will be trained with pre-recorded videos along with navigation commands as output in a supervised manner.

%5
\item Study the conditionally generated feature maps in order to identify the features triggered by the input to make sure relevant details are extracted from the content of input to the model. Make necessary changes to the models by adjusting the network architectures to make sure that intended objectives are achieved by the networks 

%6
\item Impose reinforcement learning and adversarial training on top of existing supervised learning in order to learn from real world navigation in real time.
