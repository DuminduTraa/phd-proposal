Research Objectives:



\begin{enumerate}
%1	
\item To Develop a common architecture to overcome the platform dependency problem when performing high-level navigation tasks

%2
\item To create an agent which is operating on the proposed architecture with the capable of learning the platform behavior 

%3
\item To utilize the developed architecture for autonomous navigation of different robotics platforms 

%5
\item To develop and implement efficient, effective and safe methods to train the agent as appropriate with autonomous navigation.  

%6
\item To evaluate the performance of proposed architecture by training the agent to perform some high-level navigation task and transferring the knowledge gained by one platform to a similar kind of another platform 


\end{enumerate}
