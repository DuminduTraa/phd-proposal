The main objective of this research is to develop an end-to-end pure vision based system for autonomous navigation based on conditionally generated contextualized feature maps which are adaptive to the environment and to efficiently train such system from real world diverse data.

\begin{flushleft}
	Objectives are:
\end{flushleft}

\begin{enumerate}
%1	
\item To develop a pure vision based end-to-end architecture for autonomous navigation

%2
\item To develop novel network architectures to generate intermediate contextualized feature maps conditioned on the input received from cameras

%3
\item To develop models which are dynamically adaptive to the environment of input while not forgetting what has already been learned from other environments 

%4
\item To develop models which extract both spatial and temporal information from input videos to output more realistic commands according to the particular scenario. 
 
%5
\item To develop efficient and promising approaches to train such models from large scale diverse data recorded from real world navigation as well as to train in real time.  

\end{enumerate}
